        <summary>How to use the index</summary>
        <div>
          <p>
            First, look things up by <em>noun</em> followed by an <em>adjective</em>. If that doesn't work, then try the adjective.
          </p>
          <p>In some instances, a specific word may be indexed but not appear in the sutta. </p>
          <p>
            for the sake of simplicity, thee grammar of head and sub words may not always match. For example, <i>energetic, as protector</i> might be more accurately written as <i>energetic, being as protector</i>, which more verbosely would be written as <i>energetic, being energetic as protector.</i>
          </p>
          <p>In all cases, one should actually read the sutta being refrenced and not rely on the index headings or subheadings. For example, some wrong views may be indexed in a way that is not immediately apparent that they are such. So actually reading the sutta is critical for understanding the matter at hand.</p>
          <p>Diacritics are ignored for alphabetization.</p>

        <summary>Pāli</summary>
        <div>
          <p>Pāli is given for some terms. The Pāli is generally in the singular, though the term in the text may be plural.</p>
          <p>Generally, headwords will be in English. For some words where the Pāli is more concise and well known (e.g. Bodhisatta, paccekabuddha) it will be listed under Pāli.</p>
          <p>In some cases, although a Pāli word may appear in parentheses in the head word, the Pāli word may not appear in the text.</p>
